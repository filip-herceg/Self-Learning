# Self-Learning

## What is Self-Learning?

Self-Learning is an open-source public mini-wiki that acts as a lightweight and focused way to learn about specific topics or skills.
It is meant to be used as supplementary for studying or as a neat help when encountering unknown territory.
It is supposed to be beginner-friendly. This means that everybody can understand any page and has easy access to prerequirements (ideally already linked to the page or in an overview file).
