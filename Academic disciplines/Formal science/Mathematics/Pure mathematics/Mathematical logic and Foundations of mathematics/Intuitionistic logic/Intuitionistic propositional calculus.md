Intuitionistic propositional calculus, also known as Intuitionistic logic, is a formal system that provides an alternative to classical propositional logic. It was developed by the Dutch mathematician Arend Heyting in the early 20th century as part of the broader movement towards intuitionism in mathematics.

The basic idea behind intuitionistic propositional calculus is that it should be based on constructive reasoning, which means that a proposition is only considered to be true if there is a constructive proof of it. This is in contrast to classical propositional logic, which allows for proofs by contradiction and other non-constructive methods.

## Syntax

The syntax of intuitionistic propositional calculus is similar to that of classical propositional logic. It includes the following connectives:

-   Conjunction (∧)
-   Disjunction (∨)
-   Implication (→)
-   Negation (¬)

In addition, intuitionistic propositional calculus includes a special symbol for the absurdity or contradiction, which is usually denoted by ⊥.

## Semantics

The semantics of intuitionistic propositional calculus are based on the idea of constructive reasoning. In particular, the truth value of a proposition is determined by the existence of a constructive proof of it.

More formally, a formula A is said to be true in a model M if there is a proof of A in the calculus. The proof itself is a sequence of formulas, each of which is either an axiom, a previously proven formula, or the result of applying a rule of inference.

## Rules of Inference

Intuitionistic propositional calculus has a set of rules of inference that are used to construct proofs. The most important rules are:

-   Modus ponens: If A and A → B are both true, then B is true.
-   Conjunction introduction: If A and B are both true, then A ∧ B is true.
-   Disjunction elimination: If A ∨ B is true, and we can prove C from A and D from B, then C ∨ D is true.
-   Implication introduction: If we can prove B from assuming A, then A → B is true.
-   Negation introduction: If assuming A leads to a contradiction, then ¬A is true.
-   Negation elimination: If ¬A → ⊥ is true, then A is false.
