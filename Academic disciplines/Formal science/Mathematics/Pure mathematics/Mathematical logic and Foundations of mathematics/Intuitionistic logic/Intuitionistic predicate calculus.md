Intuitionistic predicate calculus is a formal system for reasoning about predicates in a constructive setting. It is a branch of mathematical logic that is closely related to intuitionistic propositional logic, and extends it to include quantifiers and predicates.

## Syntax

The syntax of intuitionistic predicate calculus includes the following:

-   Variables: denoted by lowercase letters, such as $x$, $y$, $z$, etc.
-   Predicates: denoted by uppercase letters with subscripts, such as $P_1$, $P_2$, $Q_1$, $Q_2$, etc.
-   Connectives: $\land$ (conjunction), $\lor$ (disjunction), $\to$ (implication), $\exists$ (existential quantification), and $\forall$ (universal quantification).
-   Logical symbols: $\neg$ (negation) and parentheses.

The formation rules of the syntax are similar to those of intuitionistic propositional calculus, with the addition of the quantifiers and predicates.

## Semantics

The semantics of intuitionistic predicate calculus are based on the notion of a domain of discourse, which is a collection of objects that satisfy the predicates. The truth of a predicate is determined by whether or not it holds for a particular object in the domain of discourse.

The quantifiers are interpreted as follows:

-   $\forall x\ P(x)$ is true if $P(x)$ is true for all objects $x$ in the domain of discourse.
-   $\exists x\ P(x)$ is true if there exists an object $x$ in the domain of discourse such that $P(x)$ is true.

## Proof theory

Proof theory for intuitionistic predicate calculus includes the following:

-   Introduction and elimination rules for the connectives and quantifiers.
-   Axioms and inference rules for the logic.

The proof theory for intuitionistic predicate calculus is closely related to that of classical predicate calculus, but with some differences due to the constructive nature of intuitionistic logic.

## Applications

Intuitionistic predicate calculus has applications in computer science, particularly in the area of programming language semantics. It is also used in mathematical areas such as topology, algebraic geometry, and homotopy theory.
