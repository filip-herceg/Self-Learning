Deontic logic is a branch of modal logic that deals with the logical study of moral, ethical, and legal concepts. It is concerned with the logical relationship between obligation, permission, and prohibition, as well as concepts such as moral responsibility, permissibility, and blameworthiness. Deontic logic is used to model normative reasoning in a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and political theory.

## Obligation, Permission, and Prohibition

In deontic logic, there are three basic modal operators that are used to express obligation, permission, and prohibition:

-   **Obligation**: $\Box\phi$ (read as "it is obligatory that $\phi$")
-   **Permission**: $P\phi$ (read as "it is permitted that $\phi$")
-   **Prohibition**: $\neg P\phi$ (read as "it is prohibited that $\phi$")

These operators can be combined to form more complex statements, such as "it is obligatory that $\phi$ and permitted that $\psi$", which can be expressed as $\Box\phi\land P\psi$.

## Normative Concepts

Deontic logic is concerned with the logical relationship between normative concepts such as obligation, permission, and prohibition, as well as concepts such as moral responsibility, permissibility, and blameworthiness. Some common normative concepts in deontic logic include:

-   **Duty**: An action that is required by some moral, ethical, or legal code.
-   **Right**: A claim or entitlement that an individual has to something.
-   **Wrong**: An action that is prohibited by some moral, ethical, or legal code.
-   **Good**: Something that is morally or ethically desirable.
-   **Bad**: Something that is morally or ethically undesirable.

## Examples

Here are some examples of statements in deontic logic:

-   "It is obligatory that you tell the truth": $\Box\text{T}$
-   "It is permitted to eat meat on Fridays": $P\text{M}$
-   "It is prohibited to steal": $\neg P\text{S}$
-   "It is obligatory to pay taxes and permitted to deduct charitable donations": $\Box\text{T}\land P\text{D}$
