## Axiomatic Systems

An axiomatic system is a set of axioms that form a foundation for a mathematical theory. Axiomatic systems are used in mathematics to provide a precise and rigorous framework for reasoning about abstract concepts.

There are many different types of axiomatic systems, including first-order logic, set theory, and arithmetic. The axioms of an axiomatic system are chosen to be self-evident truths that are accepted without proof. From these axioms, a set of logical deductions can be made using rules of inference.

### First-Order Logic

First-order logic is an axiomatic system that is used to reason about mathematical objects such as numbers, sets, and functions. The basic building blocks of first-order logic are predicates and variables. Predicates are used to make statements about objects, and variables are used to represent objects.

In first-order logic, axioms are typically expressed as logical formulas that are built up from the basic building blocks using logical connectives such as conjunction and disjunction.

### Set Theory

Set theory is an axiomatic system that is used to study the properties of sets, which are collections of mathematical objects. The axioms of set theory are used to define the basic operations on sets, such as union and intersection, and to investigate the properties of infinite sets.

One of the most famous axiomatic systems in set theory is ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice). ZFC is based on a set of axioms that define the basic properties of sets and is used as a foundation for most of modern mathematics.

### Arithmetic

Arithmetic is an axiomatic system that is used to study the properties of numbers and their basic operations. The axioms of arithmetic are used to define the basic operations on numbers, such as addition and multiplication, and to investigate the properties of numbers.

One of the most famous axiomatic systems in arithmetic is Peano arithmetic. Peano arithmetic is based on a set of axioms that define the basic properties of natural numbers and is used as a foundation for most of number theory.

## Completeness Results

A completeness result is a theorem that states that a particular axiomatic system is complete, meaning that every valid statement in the system can be proven using the axioms of the system. Completeness results are important because they provide a way to show that an axiomatic system is consistent, meaning that it does not lead to contradictions.

One of the most famous completeness results is the completeness theorem for first-order logic. The completeness theorem states that a statement is provable in first-order logic if and only if it is logically valid, meaning that it is true in all possible interpretations of the logic.
