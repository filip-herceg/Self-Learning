Mathematical logic and foundations of mathematics is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of the basic principles of mathematics and the logical reasoning used to derive mathematical results. It includes the study of formal systems, set theory, and the philosophy of mathematics, as well as the foundations of mathematical structures and their properties. It plays a crucial role in providing a rigorous and logical framework for all of mathematics, and has important applications in areas such as computer science and artificial intelligence.

## Intuitionistic logic

Intuitionistic logic is based on the idea of constructive reasoning, which means that a proof of a statement exists only if a constructive method for obtaining the proof can be given. It rejects the law of excluded middle, which states that every statement is either true or false, and instead introduces the notion of "undecidability" for some statements. Intuitionistic logic has applications in computer science, particularly in the study of programming language semantics.

## Modal logic

Modal logic studies formal systems that involve the concepts of necessity and possibility, which can be used to reason about modal notions such as time, knowledge, and belief. It has applications in areas such as philosophy, linguistics, and artificial intelligence.

## Model theory

Model theory studies the properties of mathematical structures and their relationships. It seeks to understand the connection between the properties of structures and the logical statements that can be made about them. Model theory has applications in many areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and topology.

## Proof theory

Proof theory is concerned with the study of formal proofs, including their syntax, semantics, and complexity. It investigates the structure of proofs and the methods used to construct them, as well as the properties of proof systems such as consistency and completeness.

## Recursion theory

Recursion theory, also known as computability theory, studies the fundamental properties of computable functions and sets. It provides a mathematical framework for studying the limits of computation and the notion of algorithmic computability. Recursion theory has important applications in computer science, particularly in the study of computational complexity and the theory of computation.

## Set theory

Set theory is the branch of mathematical logic that studies sets, which are collections of objects. It provides a foundation for all of mathematics by defining the basic concepts of mathematical objects such as numbers, functions, and relations in terms of sets. Set theory has been used to prove many fundamental results in mathematics, including the incompleteness theorems of GÃ¶del and the continuum hypothesis.
