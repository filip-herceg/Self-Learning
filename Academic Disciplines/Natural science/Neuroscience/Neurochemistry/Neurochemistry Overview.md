# Neurochemistry Overview

Neurochemistry is the study of chemical processes and molecular mechanisms in the nervous system, including neurotransmitter systems, receptor biology, and neurotropic factors.

## Topics

### Neurotransmitter Systems
- Monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline)
- Amino acid neurotransmitters (GABA, glutamate)
- Neuropeptides and neuromodulators
- Acetylcholine system

### Receptor Biology
- Ionotropic receptors
- Metabotropic receptors
- Signal transduction cascades
- Receptor desensitization and regulation

### Molecular Mechanisms
- Gene expression in neurons
- Protein synthesis and trafficking
- Second messenger systems
- Neuroplasticity mechanisms

### Neurotropic Factors
- Growth factors (BDNF, NGF)
- Cytokines and inflammation
- Neuroimmune interactions
