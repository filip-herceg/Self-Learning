# Neuroscience Overview

Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system, encompassing the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system. It integrates multiple disciplines to understand neural structures, mechanisms, functions, and dysfunctions at all levels from molecular to behavioral.

## Scope

This section covers the biological foundations of brain structure and function, neural mechanisms, and computational approaches to understanding neural systems. Content here is organized by the scale and nature of investigation:

- **Brain Anatomy and Structure**: Macroscopic and microscopic organization of neural tissues
- **Neurophysiology**: Electrical and chemical properties of neurons and neural circuits
- **Neurochemistry**: Molecular and biochemical processes in the nervous system
- **Cognitive Neuroscience**: Neural bases of perception, cognition, and consciousness
- **Systems Neuroscience**: Organization and function of neural systems controlling behavior
- **Computational Neuroscience**: Mathematical and computational models of neural function
- **Sleep and Circadian Rhythms**: Neural mechanisms of sleep, circadian regulation, and related phenomena
