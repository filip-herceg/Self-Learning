# Neurophysiology Overview

Neurophysiology is the study of how the nervous system functions at cellular, circuit, and systems levels, focusing on electrical and chemical processes underlying neural communication and information processing.

## Topics

### Cellular Neurophysiology
- Ion channels and membrane potential
- Action potentials and neural signaling
- Synaptic transmission and plasticity
- Neurotransmitters and receptors

### Circuit Neurophysiology
- Neural circuits and network organization
- Signal integration and processing
- Oscillations and rhythmic activity

### Sensory Neurophysiology
- Sensory transduction and processing
- Receptive fields
- Sensory pathways and representations

### Motor Neurophysiology
- Motor control systems
- Neural basis of movement
- Proprioception and feedback
