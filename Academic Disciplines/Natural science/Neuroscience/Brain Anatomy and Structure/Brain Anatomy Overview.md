# Brain Anatomy and Structure Overview

Brain anatomy encompasses the structural organization of the central nervous system at multiple levels of analysis, from gross anatomical regions to cellular and subcellular structures.

## Topics

### Gross Anatomy
- Lobes and hemispheres
- Major brain regions (cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem)
- Sulci and gyri
- White matter tracts and fiber pathways

### Cellular Anatomy
- Neurons: morphology and classification
- Glial cells: types and functions
- Synaptic structure

### Developmental Anatomy
- Embryonic development of the nervous system
- Neurogenesis and neural migration
- Structural development across the lifespan
