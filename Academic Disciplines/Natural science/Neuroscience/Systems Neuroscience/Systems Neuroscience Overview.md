# Systems Neuroscience Overview

Systems neuroscience examines how different brain regions and neural systems interact to produce behavior, emotion, motivation, and homeostasis.

## Topics

### Sensory Systems
- Visual system organization
- Auditory system
- Somatosensory system
- Chemical senses (olfaction, gustation)
- Vestibular system

### Motor Systems
- Primary motor cortex and motor planning
- Basal ganglia and movement selection
- Cerebellum and motor learning
- Brainstem motor systems

### Limbic System and Emotion
- Amygdala and emotional processing
- Hippocampus and context
- Prefrontal cortex and emotional regulation
- Hypothalamus and drive states

### Neuroendocrine System
- Hypothalamic-pituitary axis
- Hormonal regulation of behavior
- Stress response systems

### Autonomic Nervous System
- Sympathetic and parasympathetic systems
- Homeostatic regulation
- Integration with central nervous system
