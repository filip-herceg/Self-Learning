# Conservation Laws Overview

Conservation laws are a fundamental concept in physics that describe the principles of the conservation of certain physical quantities in a closed system. In this page, we will provide an overview of the key concepts related to conservation laws.

## Definition of Conservation Laws

A conservation law is a principle that states that a certain physical quantity is conserved over time, that is, the quantity remains constant in a closed system. The conservation laws are based on the fundamental symmetries of nature, such as time symmetry and space symmetry.

## Types of Conservation Laws

There are several types of conservation laws in physics, including:

-   **Conservation of Energy**: 
  The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed from one form to another. In a closed system, the total amount of energy remains constant. $$\frac{dE}{dt} = \sum \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{ext}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega} $$where $E$ is the total energy of the system, and $\sum \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{ext}} \cdot \boldsymbol{\omega}$ is the sum of the external torques acting on the system.

-   **Conservation of Mass**: 
  The law of conservation of mass states that the total mass of a closed system remains constant over time. It is based on the assumption that mass is neither created nor destroyed.$$\frac{d}{dt}\int_V \rho , dV = 0$$where $\rho$ is the mass density of the system, $V$ is the volume of the system, and the integral represents the total mass within the volume.

-   **Conservation of Momentum**: 
  The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant over time. This principle is based on the fact that, in the absence of external forces, the total momentum of a system is conserved.  $$\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt} = \sum \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{ext}}$$where $\mathbf{p}$ is the momentum of the system, and $\sum \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{ext}}$ is the sum of the external forces acting on the system.

-   **Conservation of Angular Momentum**: 
  The law of conservation of angular momentum states that the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant over time. This principle is based on the fact that, in the absence of external torques, the total angular momentum of a system is conserved.  $$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \sum \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{ext}}$$where $\mathbf{L}$ is the angular momentum of the system, and $\sum \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{ext}}$ is the sum of the external torques acting on the system.


## Applications of Conservation Laws

Conservation laws are applied in many areas of physics, such as mechanics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics. They are used to explain the behavior of physical systems, from subatomic particles to galaxies.

## Conclusion

Conservation laws are a fundamental concept in physics that play a key role in the study of physical systems. The types of conservation laws, including conservation of energy, mass, momentum, and angular momentum, are all important concepts to understand. Additionally, the application of conservation laws in various areas of physics underscores their importance in the understanding of the physical world.
