# Angular Momentum Overview
Angular momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that describes the rotational equivalent of linear momentum. In this page, we will provide an overview of the key concepts related to angular momentum.

## Definition of Angular Momentum

Angular momentum is a vector quantity that is defined as the product of an object's moment of inertia and its angular velocity. It is often represented by the symbol $\mathbf{L}$ and is usually measured in units of kilogram meters squared per second (kg m$^2$/s) in the SI system of units. Mathematically, angular momentum is given by the equation:

$$\mathbf{L} = \mathbf{I}\boldsymbol{\omega}$$

where $\mathbf{I}$ is the moment of inertia and $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ is the angular velocity.

## Conservation of Angular Momentum

The law of conservation of angular momentum states that the total angular momentum of a system remains constant if no external torque acts on the system. This principle is a fundamental concept in physics and is used to explain many phenomena, such as the stability of rotating objects.

Mathematically, the conservation of angular momentum can be expressed as:

$$\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt} = \boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{ext}}$$

where $\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\text{ext}}$ is the external torque acting on the system. If the external torque is zero, then the total angular momentum is conserved.

## Torque and Angular Momentum

According to Newton's second law for rotational motion, the net torque acting on an object is equal to the rate of change of its angular momentum. This can be expressed mathematically as:

$$\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}$$

where $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is the net torque acting on the object.

## Applications of Angular Momentum

Angular momentum is an important concept in many areas of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, and quantum mechanics. It is used to describe the motion of rotating objects, such as spinning tops and planets, as well as the behavior of subatomic particles.

## Conclusion

Angular momentum is a fundamental concept in physics that plays a key role in the study of rotational motion. Its definition, conservation principle, and relationship to torque are all important concepts to understand. Additionally, the concept of angular momentum is used in many areas of physics, from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics.
