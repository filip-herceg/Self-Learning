# Mass Overview
In classical mechanics, mass is a fundamental physical property of matter that measures the amount of matter in an object. It is an important concept in many areas of physics, including mechanics, thermodynamics, and electromagnetism. In this page, we will provide an overview of the key concepts related to mass.

## Definition of Mass
Mass is a scalar quantity that is defined as the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration. It is often represented by the symbol m and is usually measured in kilograms (kg) in the SI system of units.

## Mass vs. Weight
Mass and weight are often used interchangeably in everyday language, but they are actually distinct physical quantities. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, while weight is a measure of the force exerted on an object due to gravity. The weight of an object depends on its mass and the strength of the gravitational field it is in.

## Conservation of Mass
The law of conservation of mass states that the total mass of a closed system of objects (which does not interact with the outside world) remains constant over time, regardless of any physical or chemical changes that take place within the system. This principle is a fundamental concept in physics, chemistry, and other sciences.

## Inertia and Mass
Inertia is a property of matter that describes its resistance to a change in motion. The greater the mass of an object, the greater its inertia. This is why it is more difficult to accelerate a heavy object than a lighter one.

## Relativistic Mass
In special relativity, the concept of mass is modified to take into account the effects of motion and energy. The concept of relativistic mass refers to the mass of an object as it appears to an observer who is moving relative to the object. This concept is important in high-energy physics and is often used in the study of particles traveling at speeds close to the speed of light.

## Conclusion
Mass is a fundamental physical property of matter that plays an important role in many areas of physics. Its definition, relationship to weight, and conservation principles are all important concepts to understand. Additionally, the concept of relativistic mass is a key concept in high-energy physics and the study of particles at high speeds.
