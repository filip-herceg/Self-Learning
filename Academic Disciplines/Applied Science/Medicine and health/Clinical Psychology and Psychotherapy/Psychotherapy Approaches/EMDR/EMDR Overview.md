# EMDR Overview

Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) is an evidence-based psychotherapy for trauma and anxiety disorders utilizing bilateral stimulation (eye movements) to facilitate emotional processing and psychological healing.

## Theoretical Model

- Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) theory
- Memory networks and processing
- Bilateral stimulation mechanisms
- Neurobiological effects
- Integrative approach

## Core Concepts

- Traumatic memories and emotional dysregulation
- Adaptive processing and resolution
- Bilateral stimulation and memory reconsolidation
- Window of tolerance
- Resource development

## Eight-Phase Protocol

### Phase 1: History Taking and Treatment Planning
- Trauma history assessment
- Target identification
- Treatment goals and planning

### Phase 2: Preparation and Resource Building
- Stress reduction techniques
- Coping strategies
- Internal/external resources
- Safety planning

### Phase 3: Assessment
- Target identification
- Belief structures
- Physical sensations
- SUDS (Subjective Units of Distress Scale)

### Phase 4: Desensitization
- Bilateral stimulation
- Processing and emotional release
- Monitoring and adjustment
- Reducing distress

### Phase 5: Installation
- Positive cognitions
- Strengthening positive beliefs
- Enhancing adaptive resources

### Phase 6: Body Scan
- Physical sensation assessment

- Safety and grounding

### Phase 8: Re-evaluation
- Treatment outcome assessment
- New targets or issues
- Progress monitoring
- Preparation for termination
