# Medication-Induced Movement Disorders and Other Adverse Effects Overview

These conditions arise as physiological consequences of psychotropic or other medications and require identification, monitoring, and management.

## Major Conditions (DSM-5 category)
- Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)
- Medication-induced acute dystonia
- Medication-induced acute akathisia
- Tardive dyskinesia
- Tardive dystonia
- Tardive akathisia
- Medication-induced postural tremor
- Other medication-induced movement disorders
- Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome

## Assessment
- Medication history and timing relative to symptoms
- Movement phenomenology (onset, pattern, distribution)
- Vital signs and rigidity (NMS red flags)
- Rating scales (AIMS for tardive dyskinesia)
- Differential: primary movement disorders, catatonia

## Management
- Discontinue or reduce offending agent when safe
- Switch to lower-risk medications
- Pharmacologic treatments (e.g., VMAT2 inhibitors for tardive dyskinesia; beta-blockers for akathisia)
- Emergency care for NMS
- Patient education and monitoring plans

## Prevention and Monitoring
- Use lowest effective doses
- Regular movement side-effect monitoring (AIMS)
- Slow tapering to reduce discontinuation syndromes
