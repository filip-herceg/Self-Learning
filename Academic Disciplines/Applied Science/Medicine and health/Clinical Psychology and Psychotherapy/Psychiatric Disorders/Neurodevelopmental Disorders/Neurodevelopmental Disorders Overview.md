# Neurodevelopmental Disorders Overview

Neurodevelopmental disorders involve early-onset impairments in personal, social, academic, or occupational functioning due to atypical brain development.

## Major Conditions
- Intellectual disability (severity specifiers)
- Autism spectrum disorder
- ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, combined)
- Specific learning disorders (reading, writing, math)
- Communication disorders (language, speech sound, fluency)
- Motor disorders (developmental coordination, stereotypic movement, tic disorders including Tourette)

## Assessment
- Developmental history and milestones
- Cognitive and neuropsychological testing
- Adaptive functioning measures
- Behavioral rating scales (e.g., ADHD scales)
- Speech-language evaluation
- Educational assessments and IEP planning

## Etiology and Risk
- Genetic factors and heritability
- Prenatal/perinatal complications
- Environmental exposures
- Neurobiological correlates

## Intervention and Support
- Early intervention and special education
- Behavioral therapies (ABA, parent training)
- Speech and occupational therapy
- Social skills training
- Pharmacotherapy (e.g., stimulants for ADHD)
- Classroom accommodations and supports

## Comorbidity
- Learning disorders and ADHD
- Anxiety and mood disorders
- Sleep and sensory processing issues
