## Assessment
- Cognitive screening and neuropsychological testing
- Functional status and ADLs/IADLs
- Onset/course and progression
- Neuroimaging and labs to rule out reversible causes

## Etiology and Pathophysiology
- Neurodegenerative processes
- Vascular contributions
- Traumatic and infectious causes

## Treatment and Management
- Cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine (AD)
- Vascular risk reduction
- Cognitive rehabilitation and environmental supports
- Caregiver education and support
- Safety (driving, medication management)
