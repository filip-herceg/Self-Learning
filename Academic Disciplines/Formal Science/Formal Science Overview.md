Formal Science is concerned with the study of abstract concepts and formal systems. This means that it is primarily focused on the study of logic, formal languages, and mathematical structures. Unlike Natural Science, Formal Science is not concerned with empirical observation or experimentation. Instead, it relies on abstract reasoning and logical deduction to develop formal models and systems.

## Mathematics

Mathematics is one of the most well-known branches of Formal Science. It deals with the study of numbers, quantities, and shapes, as well as the relationships between them. Mathematics provides a framework for formalizing ideas and concepts, and it is widely used in the Natural Sciences, Engineering, and Economics, among other fields.

## Computer Science

Computer Science is another important branch of Formal Science. It deals with the study of algorithms, data structures, and computational systems. Computer Science provides a framework for developing and analyzing software and hardware systems, as well as the study of artificial intelligence, databases, and computer graphics. Computer Science is widely used in a variety of applications, including web development, mobile applications, scientific simulations, and more.

## Info

In addition to Mathematics and Computer Science, other branches of Formal Science include theoretical physics, theoretical linguistics, and formal logic. These fields all rely on abstract reasoning and formal models to develop theories and systems, and they are used in a wide range of applications, from scientific research to practical engineering and design.
