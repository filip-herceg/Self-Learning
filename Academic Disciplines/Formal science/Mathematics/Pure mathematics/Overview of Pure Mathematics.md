Pure mathematics is the branch of mathematics that deals with abstract concepts and theories, without any direct application to the real world. It is concerned with developing and proving mathematical theorems and formulas, and has applications in fields such as physics, engineering, computer science, and economics.

|Branch|	Description|

|[Algebra](#algebra)|	The study of mathematical structures such as groups, rings, and fields, and the manipulation of abstract symbols and expressions.|
|[Analysis](#analysis)|	The study of limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, and infinite series, and their applications in various fields.|
|[Arithmetic](#arithmetic)|	The study of the properties of numbers, especially the integers, and the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.|
|[Geometry and Topology](#geometry%20and%20topology)|	The study of shape, size, and spatial relationships, including the properties of figures and their transformations.|
|[Mathematical Logic and Foundations](#mathematical%20logic%20and%20foundations)|	The study of the basic principles of mathematics, including formal languages, axiomatic systems, set theory, and the philosophy of mathematics.|
|[Number Theory](#number%20theory)|	The study of numbers and their properties, including prime numbers, Diophantine equations, and algebraic number theory.|
|[Probability Theory](#probability%20theory)|	The study of random events and their likelihood of occurrence, and the mathematical framework for analyzing and modeling uncertainty.|


## Algebra

Algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies mathematical structures such as groups, rings, fields, and modules. It involves the study of equations and their solutions, as well as the manipulation of abstract symbols and expressions.

## Analysis

Analysis is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, and infinite series. It is concerned with the study of functions and their properties, and has applications in fields such as physics, engineering, and economics.

## Arithmetic

Arithmetic is the branch of mathematics that deals with the properties of numbers, especially the integers. It includes the study of operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as the properties of primes, divisibility, and modular arithmetic.

## Geometry and Topology

Geometry and topology are two related branches of mathematics that deal with the study of shape, size, and spatial relationships. Geometry is concerned with the properties of figures such as points, lines, and angles, while topology is concerned with the study of properties that are preserved under continuous transformations, such as stretching and bending.

## Mathematical Logic and Foundations of Mathematics

Mathematical logic and foundations of mathematics are concerned with the study of the basic principles of mathematics and the logical foundations of mathematical reasoning. This includes the study of formal languages, axiomatic systems, set theory, and the philosophy of mathematics.

## Number Theory

Number theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of numbers and their properties, especially the integers. It includes the study of prime numbers, Diophantine equations, and algebraic number theory.

## Probability Theory

Probability theory is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events and their probabilities. It includes the study of random variables, probability distributions, and stochastic processes.
