Modal logic of belief change is a type of modal logic that is used to model the process of changing one's beliefs. It is also known as belief revision theory, and it is an area of research in artificial intelligence and philosophy.

## Definitions

Belief change is the process of modifying one's beliefs in light of new evidence or information. Modal logic of belief change provides a framework for modeling this process using modal operators. The two main modal operators used in this framework are the belief revision operator and the belief update operator.

The belief revision operator is used to represent the process of revising one's beliefs in light of new evidence or information. It is typically denoted by the symbol "B", and is read as "it is believed that". The belief update operator is used to represent the process of updating one's beliefs in light of new evidence or information. It is typically denoted by the symbol "U", and is read as "it is now believed that".

## Examples

An example of a belief revision operation might be:

-   Initially, it is believed that "the weather is sunny".
-   New evidence is received that "it is raining".
-   The belief revision operator is applied, and the new belief is "it is not the case that the weather is sunny".

An example of a belief update operation might be:

-   Initially, it is believed that "there are no clouds in the sky".
-   New evidence is received that "there are some clouds in the sky".
-   The belief update operator is applied, and the new belief is "there are some clouds in the sky".

## Formulas

Modal logic of belief change uses formulas to represent beliefs and belief changes. The formulas are typically constructed using modal operators, propositional symbols, and connectives. The following are some examples of formulas used in this framework:

-   Bp - it is believed that "p" (where "p" is a propositional symbol)
-   ¬Bp - it is not believed that "p"
-   Bp ∧ Bq - it is believed that "p" and it is believed that "q"
-   Bp → Bq - if it is believed that "p", then it is believed that "q"
-   Up - it is now believed that "p"
-   ¬Up - it is not now believed that "p"
-   Up ∧ Uq - it is now believed that "p" and it is now believed that "q"
-   Up → Uq - if it is now believed that "p", then it is now believed that "q"
