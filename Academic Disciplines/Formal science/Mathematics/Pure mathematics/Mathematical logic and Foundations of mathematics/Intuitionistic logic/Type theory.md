Type theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies the formal systems that underlie computer programming languages and mathematical proof systems. In type theory, all expressions are assigned a type, which specifies the set of values that the expression can take. The type system also defines the rules for combining expressions of different types, and for constructing new types from existing ones.

The development of type theory was motivated by the desire to create more rigorous and reliable software systems, and to provide a foundation for the formalization of mathematics. Type theory has since become an important tool for reasoning about computer programs, as well as for exploring the foundations of mathematics.

## Background

Type theory was first developed in the 1930s by the logician Alonzo Church as a foundation for his work on the lambda calculus, a model of computation based on function abstraction and application. Later, in the 1960s and 1970s, type theory was developed further by computer scientists and mathematicians, who saw its potential as a foundation for programming languages and proof systems.

## Types

In type theory, all expressions are assigned a type. Types can be thought of as sets of values, and expressions as elements of those sets. For example, the expression "2 + 2" has type "integer", which is the set of all integer values. The expression "true" has type "boolean", which is the set of all truth values.

Types can be combined using type constructors, which take one or more types as input and produce a new type as output. For example, the type constructor "list" takes a type as input and produces a new type that represents lists of elements of that type. The type constructor "function" takes two types as input, the type of the argument and the type of the result, and produces a new type that represents functions from the first type to the second type.

## Type systems

A type system is a set of rules for assigning types to expressions and for combining expressions of different types. The rules of a type system ensure that expressions are well-formed and that they behave in a predictable way.

Type systems can be divided into two broad categories: static and dynamic. In a static type system, the types of expressions are determined at compile time and checked at runtime. In a dynamic type system, the types of expressions are determined at runtime and checked as the program executes.

## Applications

Type theory has many applications in computer science and mathematics. In computer science, type theory is used to design and analyze programming languages, and to ensure the correctness of software systems. In mathematics, type theory is used to provide a foundation for formalizing mathematical proofs and to explore the foundations of mathematics.

One of the most popular applications of type theory is in functional programming, a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of functions and immutable data structures. In functional programming, types are used to ensure that functions are applied to the correct types of arguments, and to ensure that data structures are used in a consistent way.
