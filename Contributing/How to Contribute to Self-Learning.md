## Contributing to Existing Topics

If you want to contribute to an existing topic, you can simply edit the corresponding `.md` file in the relevant folder. Make sure your contribution follows our [Style Guide](STYLE_GUIDE.md) and that you include all relevant information.

## Creating New Topics

If you want to create a new topic, please make sure it fits within one of the existing academic disciplines. Create a new folder for the discipline if one doesn't already exist, and add your new topic to the appropriate sub-folder. Make sure to include a table of contents and any relevant links in your new `.md` file.
